chongming_treaty_port_title;The Chongming Treaty Port;;;;;;;;;;;;;
chongming_treaty_port_desc;Chongming is a sizeable island right in the estuary of the Yangtze River. With the growing importance of Shangai and Soochow in the european trade with China, getting control over Chongming would give us a strong position on the coast of China. Further more, we will enforce a 75km exclusion zone from the surroundings of Nantong until the tip of the peninsula north of the island, securing our position, at the cost of displacing some Chinese in the area.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
soochow_treaty_port_title;The Soochow Treaty Port;;;;;;;;;;;;;
soochow_treaty_port_desc; Our continued interest in the Yangtze River has been pretty lucrative through the years. During the war, there were talks about what to get from the Chinese at this point, some suggested getting a port around the Yellow River's Estuary, to diversify our operations and get a way to easily threaten the imperial capital of Beijing, but the more popular option is to expand our holdings on the Yangtze by demanding the city of Soochow and its surroundings. Soochow is already one of the free ports that was estabilished after the 1st Opium War and it grew pretty wealthy with our continued expansion around Shangai. Control over Soochow would not only mean be pretty lucrative, but also give us a more defensible position on the Yangtze.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
